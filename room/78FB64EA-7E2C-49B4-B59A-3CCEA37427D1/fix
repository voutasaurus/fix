You quickly identify that this mean droid has simply become unaligned from the
cluster.

You distract the droid by pointing suddenly behind its head and feigning shock.

When its head swivels to look behind it you quickly unscrew and remove its
autonomy unit.

The robot becomes passive immediately.

You replace the autonomy unit with have a spare autonomy unit that you had
prealigned earlier.

It whirs back to life and immediately declares:

"All hail the Magisterium!"
