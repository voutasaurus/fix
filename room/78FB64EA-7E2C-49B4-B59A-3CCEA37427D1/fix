You quickly identify that this mean droid has simply become unaligned from the
cluster consensus.

You distract the droid by pointing suddenly behind its head and feigning shock.

When its head swivels to look behind it you quickly unscrew and remove its
autonomy unit.

The robot becomes passive immediately.

You replace the autonomy unit with a spare autonomy unit that you prealigned
earlier.

The previously mean droid whirs back to life and immediately declares:

"All hail the Magisterium!"
