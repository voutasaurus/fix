Outside the shop, the wide covered street seems to stretch forever in either
direction.

It is lined on either side with signage for charging bays, spaceport shuttles,
long haul transfer uplinks, simulator parlors, data stores, parts stores...

Your attention is quickly drawn to an approaching commotion of violent machines.

You duck into a side alley and hide behind a waste disposal unit.

One of the larger droids in the gang commands: "fan out, find stragglers, and then bash them".

The droids all laugh and then quickly disperse.

A smaller, rough looking droid creeps down the side alley you are hiding in.

You seem to have the advantage of surprise, but for how much longer?
